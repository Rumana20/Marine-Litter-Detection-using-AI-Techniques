# Marine-Litter-Detection-using-AI-Techniques

The Project aimed at developing an algorithm that Detects, Classifies, and can quantify marine litter images collected using underwater vehicles (AUVs and ROVs). This approach can make the process of monitoring and cleaning marine trash effective and cost-efficient




Business Problem

Marine litter is one of the major environmental threats of the twenty-first century. The growing amounts of generated litter and the slow degradation rate result in the accumulation of litter in the oceans, posing a serious threat for the healthy oceans. Removing litter from oceans is of immediate importance but to do that, it's firstly required that we have an understanding of how much litter is present in the location of interest. Many methods have been introduced before to get an idea about the quantity of trash that is present but they are labour-intensive, incur high financial costs or do not cover large surface areas. 

However, in recent times, new methods have been introduced that make use of ROVs (remotely operated vehicles) and AUVs (autonomous underwater vehicles) that go deep into the oceans and send back videos or images of trash present in a particular area of the ocean. This method coupled with computer vision techniques like object detection and instance segmentation and modern deep learning technologies can be used to quantify marine litter without having to physically remove it to estimate it. 


Hence, in this study we aim to build an algorithm that will be capable of trash detection, classification and quantification in real time. By quantification we mean to give information on the estimated weight of the trash, so that the weight of the trash present can be directly transmitted to the team above handling the rov where they can then estimate if the robotic arm of the rov will be able to handle that weight and thus they can estimate if there is sufficient amount of trash which needs to be taken care of immediately and based on that they can monitor and clean marine pollution making the process of monitoring marine trash below in the depths of the ocean a cost-efficient task with the use of AUVs and ROVs.
